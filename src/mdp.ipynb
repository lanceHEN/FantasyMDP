    "# Fantasy Football MDP\n",
    "We define a finite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) for fantasy football, where:\n",
    "- states represent the list of positions drafted\n",
    "- actions represent selecting the best available player at a particular position\n",
    "  - we set limits on the number of players per position to draft (this prevents spamming QB, a pretty bad strategy!)\n",
    "  - we define \"available players\" as any player whose rank is at least as great as the given pick number, and has not already been drafted\n",
    "    - due to the deterministic nature of obtaining the best player at a given position at a given pick, we do not need to store the player explicitly, cutting space.\n",
    "- rewards represent the total number of projected points for that player\n",
    "- discount factor of 1\n",
    "- actions are deterministic, so probabilities are always 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper bound of 9! total states before accounting for duplicates in positions\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, because our actions only consider the single best available player at each position, there's a smaller action space (no more than 6 actions per state!).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the MDP is tractable, and we can use policy iteration to find an optimal policy, i.e. a way to approach each round in the draft, position-by-position,\n",
    "to maximize total projected team points."
